 I am a senior undergraduate student in the Biomedical Engineering program at Shantou University. The [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://eng.stu.edu.cn/bme/eng/News.aspx?id=128) at Shantou University is a joint establishment between Shantou University and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and it offers an all-English curriculum. So I have had four years of English-medium instruction and have gained experience through numerous research projects. I am also a research assistant in [Dr. Guo](https://eng.stu.edu.cn/bme/eng/Teacher.aspx?id=60198)'s lab, where my current research focuses on biosensors, chemical sensors, microfluidics, and Point of care testing.
